Given(/^I am on the "(.*?)" Page$/) do |arg1|
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

When(/^I select "(.*?)"$/) do |arg1|
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Then(/^I should be on the "(.*?)" Page$/) do |arg1|
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
